# Touchless-Museum

# Idea
The idea comes from the arrival of the virus at the beginning of 2020, and the fact that you have to touch a touch screen to be able to interact with it, and this in public places. 

For example, when we want to see a summary of all the works and their position in the museum, it is nice to have an interactive screen that gives us all the information we need to find our way around. That's why I wanted to create this application that demonstrate the possibility to create a interactive experience that shows all the artworks of the museum, their location, and many more informations in a playful and practical way: **Using your hands**.
