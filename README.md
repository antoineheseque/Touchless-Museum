# Touchless-Museum

# Idea
The idea comes from the arrival of the virus at the beginning of 2020, and the fact that you have to touch a touch screen to be able to interact with it, and this in public places. 

For example, when we want to see a summary of all the works and their position in the museum, it is nice to have an interactive screen that gives us all the information we need to find our way around. That's why I wanted to create this application that demonstrate the possibility to create a interactive experience that shows all the artworks of the museum, their location, and many more informations in a playful and practical way: **Using your hands**.

# Requirement
For this project, you will need:
- A **Leap motion controller**
- A **computer** *(obviously)*

- **Unity v2019.4.0f1** LTS *(Only if you want to open the project)*

# How to use
/!\ At this time, there is a bug in the build version where one hand is invisible. Please open and play the project to have both hands visible and play the full experience. /!\

## Start the application
To start the application, you have to unzip the file named **Touchless-Museum.zip** and double-click on the **Touchless-Museum.exe** executable.

## Open the project
The project is using the **LeapMotion SDK v4.5.0** with **Unity v2019.4.0f1 LTS**
Open the project with Unity and press play, that's it! (Don't forget to have a leap motion connected to the computer).

# Bugs
